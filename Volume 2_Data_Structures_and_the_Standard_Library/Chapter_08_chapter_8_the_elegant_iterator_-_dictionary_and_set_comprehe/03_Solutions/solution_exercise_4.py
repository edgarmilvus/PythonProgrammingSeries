# ==========================================

numbers = [1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 15, 4, 1]

# Use set comprehension to filter and transform
# 1. Filter: Check if the number is odd (n % 2 != 0).
# 2. Transform: Square the odd number (n**2).
odd_squares = {n**2 for n in numbers if n % 2 != 0}

# print(odd_squares)

# Description: Basic Code Example
# ==========================================

# Input list has duplicates and is ordered
data = [10, 5, 10, 20, 5]

# Set comprehension
result_set = {x for x in data}

# Output: {20, 5, 10}
# 1. Duplicates (5, 10) are removed.
# 2. The original insertion order is NOT guaranteed (though modern Python sets maintain insertion order, relying on this for filtering is dangerous and not the primary purpose of the set).

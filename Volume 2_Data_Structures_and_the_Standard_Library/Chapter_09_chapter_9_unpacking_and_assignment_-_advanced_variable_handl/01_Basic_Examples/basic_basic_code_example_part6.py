# 5. The Pythonic Variable Swap (a powerful application of unpacking)
a = 100
b = 200
print(f"Before swap: a={a}, b={b}")

# The magic: The RHS creates a temporary tuple (b, a). This tuple is then unpacked
# back into the LHS variables (a, b), effectively swapping their values.
a, b = b, a

print(f"After swap: a={a}, b={b}")

# Description: Solution for Exercise 4
# ==========================================

# Input data
values = [5, 10, 12, 20, 25, 30]

# Solution: Conditional output based on divisibility by 10
# Structure: [output_if_true if condition else output_if_false for item in iterable]
modified_values = ["TEN" if x % 10 == 0 else x for x in values]

# Output verification
print(modified_values)
# Expected Output: [5, 'TEN', 12, 'TEN', 25, 'TEN']

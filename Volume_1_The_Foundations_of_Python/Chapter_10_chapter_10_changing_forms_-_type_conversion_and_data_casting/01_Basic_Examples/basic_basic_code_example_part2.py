# Description: Basic Code Example
# ==========================================

# Example 1: Trying to convert text to a number
bad_input_1 = "Score: 100"
# int(bad_input_1)  <-- This would immediately raise a ValueError

# Example 2: Trying to convert a float string to an integer
# The int() function cannot handle the decimal point directly from a string.
bad_input_2 = "45.8"
# int(bad_input_2)  <-- This would also raise a ValueError

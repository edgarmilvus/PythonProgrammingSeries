# ==========================================

    def greet(name: str) -> str:
        # 2. Inner Function Definition: This is the function that will be returned.
        # It is defined *lexically* within greeting_factory's scope.
        # It accesses 'style', which is a *non-local* or *free* variable to 'greet'.
        
        # 3. Core Action: Uses the retained 'style' and the new 'name' argument.
        return f"{style}, {name}!"

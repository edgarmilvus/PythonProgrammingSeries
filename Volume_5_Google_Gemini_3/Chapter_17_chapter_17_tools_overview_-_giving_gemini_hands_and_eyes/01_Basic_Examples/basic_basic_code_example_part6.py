# MISTAKE: Tool is defined but not passed to the model configuration.
search_tool = types.Tool(google_search={}) 

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model=MODEL_NAME,
    contents=prompt,
    # config parameter is missing or does not include the tools list
    # The model cannot use the search tool.
) 
# Result: The model will use its internal, potentially outdated knowledge.

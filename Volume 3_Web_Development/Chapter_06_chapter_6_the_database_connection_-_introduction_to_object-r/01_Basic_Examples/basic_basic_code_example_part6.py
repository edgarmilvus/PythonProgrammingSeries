# 4a. Create Python objects. This is the ORM in action!
note_a = Note(title='Project Kickoff', content='Start planning the new API endpoints.')
note_b = Note(title='Grocery List', content='Milk, Bread, Cheese.')

# 4b. Add the objects to the session. They are now "staged" for insertion.
session.add(note_a)
session.add(note_b)

# 4c. Commit the transaction. This executes the SQL INSERT statements.
session.commit()
